   <p>I went to Kipsuter Boys high school and thereafter joined Meru university to pursue Bachelor of Science computer science. I have had passion for coding after my college studies. My dream came through after securing the scholarship in Moringa school. Due to high demand in web development in the market, I felt I will only be relevant if I will take the course. I look forward to securing a job thereafter and provide challenges faced in the current tech market.</p></div>
